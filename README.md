# heartbeat-bill

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in early May signed into law a so-called “heartbeat” bill, banning abortion as early as six weeks into pregnancy. This mini-project aims to use geopandas to visualise US state demographics by scraping state-level data from Wikipedia and US News to create choropleth maps. I consider education attainment rates, US House Rep/Dem seats, religiosity, maternal mortality rate (MMR/10,000), urbanisation rate and higher education rankings. 

This project can be expanded by using county level data for higher definition, though certain metrics may not be available at the county level.
